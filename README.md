# ABS-Shelling-s-Model-of-Segregation

In this assignment, we provide a comparative analysis of how the defined model with different configurations (type of society, density, moving strategy) behaves and discuss the observed outcomes, highlighting the differences in patterns of segregation or integration.  
Some of the things in addition to the assignment definition were considered, which are not directly mentioned in the assignment:  
•	The overall density of the simulation and the composition of the subtypes (light, pale, and dark) were defined by the assignment definition. Since the question does not directly mention the composition of overall blue and red, I assume equal proportion, i.e., the number of the agents according to the density and an equal number of blue and red, where light, blue, and dark within the blue and red were calculated based on the type of society.  
•	For each of the 3x3x3 = 27 configurations, I use five different runs (each with 1000 iterations at most) and calculate the average from them. Since all runs do not end up in the same number of iterations, I use padding to take the maximum step to calculate the average scores.
